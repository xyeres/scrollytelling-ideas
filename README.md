### What is this? 

This repo contains several ideas I'm exploring creating `"scrollytelling"` sites using GSAP and ScrollTrigger. Some of the content is based on the paid course [ScrollyTelling 101 from Gregg Fine](https://store.thecodecreative.com/view/courses/scrollytelling)

#### Additonal resources I found interesting: 
- [What is GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) 
- [GSAP Ease Visualizer](https://greensock.com/ease-visualizer/)
- [ScrollTrigger Docs](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger)

#### Examples:
There are *many* examples to be found at places like awwwards.com, or [GSAP Showcase](https://greensock.com/showcase/) but here are a few specific exmaples:

Scrollytelling is not one tool or library but a collection of ideas and techniques that require attention to detail. There are many tools that may assist in achieving the desired look. Animations are a big part of the process and GSAP is not the only option when picking an animation library. Here are a few other libraries to check out: 
#### Animation Libraries
- [gsap](https://greensock.com/gsap/) — professional-grade animation for the modern web
- [popmotion](https://popmotion.io/) — simple libraries for delightful interfaces
- [animejs](https://animejs.com/) — a lightweight library with a simple and powerful API
- [mojs](https://mojs.github.io/) — the motion graphics toolbelt for the web
- [spirit](https://spiritapp.io/) — the ultimate tool to create high-quality animations directly in the browser
