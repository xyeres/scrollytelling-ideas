### What is this? 

This repo contains several ideas I'm exploring creating `"scrollytelling"` sites using GSAP and ScrollTrigger. Some of the content is based on the paid course [ScrollyTelling 101 from Gregg Fine](https://store.thecodecreative.com/view/courses/scrollytelling)

#### Additonal resources I found interesting: 
- [What is GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) 
- [GSAP Ease Visualizer](https://greensock.com/ease-visualizer/)
- [ScrollTrigger Docs](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger)

#### Examples:
There are *many* examples to be found at places like awwwards.com, or [GSAP Showcase](https://greensock.com/showcase/) but here are a few specific exmaples:
